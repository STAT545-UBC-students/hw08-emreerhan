## STAT545 Homework 08

This repo contains an app for exploring the BC Liquor dataset that can be found [here](https://deanattali.com/files/bcl-data.csv).

The initial code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

For my homework, I contributed four pieces:
* The BC Liquor logo in the sidebar.
* Tabs for viewing the plot, and the table.
* Using the `DT` package for having an interactive table.
* A download button for downloading a comma delimited file of the filtered data.

## Accessing the rshiny app

You can either clone this repo and run the code locally, or you can view the shiny app hosted on shinyapps.io [here](https://emrerhan.shinyapps.io/bcl-rshiny/)
